      "description": "If you're looking for a local favorite, this is it. With breaks headed down both sides, this point is crowded almost every day. Many locals use this spot, but its good to remember that this is a difficult spot. Large barrels, rocky reefs, and urchins are things to look out for at this break. You can paddle out from the coast or jump off the rock line right near the harbor. There's free parking at the harbor and equipment for rent at Hawaii Surfboard Rentals."

      "description": "A great spot for beginners! Be warned this spot gets crazy busy, but for newcomers the low swells and lack of reef hazards are a welcome invitation. Do be careful of the occasional rock reef poking out the sand. Park by the Honolulu Zoo or any smaller side street by the beach. Easiest entry is by paddling out from the beach. Nearby board rentals make it an easy pick for new beginners and visiting families."

      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "description": "Slightly larger waves for the more intermediate surfers here at Kewalos. Surf can get up to 6ft with some barrels. The break splits into a easier left break and a longer right break. This location stays mildly busy but can be more free than some other break locations. Be careful about the break coming over the shallow reef in some areas but otherwise enjoy the surf!"
